# File-Encrypting
 Python program that asks for user input, then encrypts the input and stores it in a file.
The program assigns a dictionary with characters for each letter in the alphabet,
then uses a function to create a new file and change each letter into its new char.
The file is saved as encrptedfile.txt and a sample output text file is included.
